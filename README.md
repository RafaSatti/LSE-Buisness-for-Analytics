# Analysing Supermarket Data 

Background

2Market is a global supermarket that wants to understand customer’s purchase behaviours and effective marketing strategies to optimize its services in-stores globally and online. To be able to find significant insights on the data, I first listed relevant questions to answer during the analysis process that will help get a better and clearer understanding of the data. Using the 5 why method helped me to get to the questions listed below.
 
 1. Average age of customers based on country/marital status
 2. Does customer’s income influence how much they spend on shopping and how it varies based on demographic?
 3. If number of children and teenagers in a household influence customer’s spending? In-store to online shopping ratio?
 4. In-store to online shopping ratio?
    
Problem Statement:
• Understanding 2Market’s customer’s demographic
• What is 2Market’s most effective advertisement channel
• Understanding 2Market’s best-selling product
