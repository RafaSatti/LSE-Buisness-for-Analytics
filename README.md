# Data Analytics for business
Exploratory analysis and presenting insights.

This repository contains analysis conducted on a global supermarket group to understand it's customers,
sales, purchasing behaviour, and potential relationships between advertising and purchases. 

In this project I've leveraged Excel and SQL to wrangle and mainuplate data 
in order to deliver insights and create captiavting dashboards on Tableau to solve business problems.

This repository will include:
- A tableau dashboard to deliver insights to audience and stakeholders
- A technical report to outline analytical approach and summary of findings
- A presentation to communicate key findings and help inform decision making
